# React Vite App

This is a React application powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). It's a fast, modern setup for React development with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6 or later)

If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
