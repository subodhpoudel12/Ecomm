# Full Stack React + Express App

This repository contains a full-stack application with a **React frontend** powered by **Vite**, **pnpm**, **ShadCN**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript** for the client side, and an **Express** server with **MongoDB** for the backend (using **npm** and **JavaScript**).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:


- **client**: The frontend application where React, Vite, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, and TypeScript are used.
- **server**: The backend API server built using **Express** and **MongoDB** (using **npm** and **JavaScript**).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16 or later)
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** (v6 or later) for the frontend
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** for the backend

### Installing pnpm

If you don't have `pnpm` installed for the client, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
